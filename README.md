#delete_node_modules

- Removes node modules from all of your JS projects.
- Can be applied to a single project or a folder containing all of your projects.

#Implementation

- `git clone <url>`
- Change the paths in the array _addresses_ to the folders where you've saved your projects.
- In the case of a single project, include its path in the _addresses_
- `node index.js`

#OR

- Copy code from `index.js` to a local js file -> save -> update _addresses_ -> run

#Warning

- Do not use directly on C: or D: drives.
